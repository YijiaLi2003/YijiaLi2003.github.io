        <!-- Assignment 1 -->
        <section>

        <!-- Assignment 2 -->
        <section>
            <h2>Assignment 2: Assignment Title</h2>
            <p>
                **Approach:** For this task, I approached it by setting up a simple user interface and then incrementally adding functionality. My main challenge was handling edge cases, which I addressed through extensive testing.
